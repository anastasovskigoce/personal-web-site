Hey everyone, thank you for visiting my page. My name is Goce I am an Engineering Manager at Alarm.com where I currently lead several teams of iOS and Android engineers. After several years working on an app that lets you control IoT devices I took a break and spent some time working in FinTech as a team lead at Capital One. 

In my free time, I am either working on side projects or conference talks. Check out my GitHub page or my conferences section for more details.
