I have been working as a Mobile Developer since 2014 and I currently lead a team of several mobile engineers. Most of my carrier was spent on an app that lets you control IoT devices and some part of my career was spent working on a banking app. In my free time, I am either working on side projects or conference talks. Check out my [GitHub page](http://github.com/anastasovskigoce) or my conferences section for more details.

In the beginning of my career I spent 2.5 years as a teaching & research assistant, so I am comfortable talking to a group of people. During that time I published 4 research papers and presented them to the academic community. Recently I gave a technical talk on Code Reviews and how they can be used as a teaching tool.

In my free time, you will find me traveling, cooking or learning a new spoken language.
