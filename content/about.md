I have been working as a Mobile Developer since 2014. Initially I started as a junior developer, transitioned through all the senior roles and currently I lead a team of 8 Android and iOS engineers. I spent most of my carrier working on an app that lets you control IOT devices and some part of my career was spent working on Capital Ones banking app. In my free time I am working on an app that provides the user with daily motivational quotes. I plan on expanding the app to provide daily motivcational images, videos and music. I have setup the server for it (spring boot), database (MongoDB) and will soon release it.

The app is using MVI architectual pattern, Retrofit for networking, Room DB, has support for notifications, WorkManager, Broadcasting, LiveData and is 100% Kotlin. In additiong to Android/Kotlin, Spring Boot, MongoDB, I have experience is .NET, C# and SQL.

I have spent 2.5 years as a teaching & research assistant, so I am comfortable talking to a group of people. I have published 4 research papers and presented them to the academic community. I recently gave a talk on code reviews and how they can be used to train and invest in your team. The talk was given to the DC Android group meeting internal talk at my current company and was supposed to be given to 2 other conferences if the covid pandemic did not hit us. Check out my conferences section for more details.

In my free time, you will find me traveling, cooking or learning a new spoken language.
