I hold a Bachlors and a Masters degree in Computer Science. In the beggining of my career I spent 2.5 years working as a research assitant, under Dr. Katerina Goseva, studying the characteristics of HTTP attacks and vulnerability scans using data mining and patter recognition. After getting my masters degree, I realized that academia is not my cup of tea, therefore, I left West Virigina University in 2014 and joined alarm.com as a FullStack Software Engineer. Shortly after I joined alarm.com I started working with Android and immdiatelly fell in love with it. I am currently based in Washington D.C. where I lead a team of several Android and iOS engineers.

In my free time, you will find me traveling, cooking or learning a new spoken language.
