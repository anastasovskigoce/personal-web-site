Hey everyone, thank you for visiting my page. My name is Goce I am a Mobile Engineer at Alarm.com where I currently lead a team of iOS and Android engineers. After several years working on an app that lets you control IoT devices I took a break and spent some time working on Capital Ones’s banking app. 

In my free time, I am either working on side projects or conference talks. Currently I am building an app that gives users daily motivational quotes, they can save, share, upvodte/downvote the quote as well as search existing quotes by author. The app is communicating to a REST API, written in Kotlin using Spring Boot, to get the quote data. I have used the MVI architectual pattern as well as Jetpack componets (Navigation, ViewModel, Room…) to build out the cleint. Check out my GitHub page or my conferences section for more details.
